                                       The artifact I chose for this module is an online store that I created for a course in 2017.  This online store specialized in various coats and jackets to browse and if wanted, potentially buy in which the program will take you to the purchase menu accordingly.  I chose this one and including this into my portfolio for the reason to showcase the design and engineering it took to create the program. This one out of the others I will be submitting really capsulizes the design it takes to create such a program.  Each tab created is a link to another part of the store, getting the code right to take you to the specific details wanted took a lot of time to make sure the development was correct and in terrific working order.  This artifact is my first one and no improvement suggestions were given to me, although for module 4 and 5 I will be submitting different artifacts to showcase algorithm and database design.
   I do believe this one meets the criteria for design and engineering but possibly not so much in the algorithm and database in which will come later.  This whole online store was a very difficult artifact to make with my knowledge.  There was a tremendous amount of coding errors along the way and I am sure there will be some found in the future. I learned that you need to give yourself enough time to create something like this where you can have the patience and time to make any corrections along the way.  It brings light to my eyes the amount of hard mental work is put into a program of this nature, let alone huge databases and infrastructure to our virtual world.

                                     This artifact is a created Fibonacci calculation algorithm.  I believe I created this one as well in 2017 and it acted as a basic calculation sequence that will give you the Fibonacci algorithm corresponding with the digits introduced.  The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers in which every number after the first two , 0 and 1 is the sum of the two preceding numbers.   These have been used within introductory algorithm courses as well.  I believe this is a fantastic artifact to add to the ePortfolio to really showcase the creating of algorithm based programs.  I will await feedback on what needs to be improved on this artifact and just to let the teacher know, that this only covers the algorithm enhancement section of this course.
   This does and should meet the course objectives covering algorithm enhancements,  there is a separate database program that was created to cover the last portion of all enhancements needed for this course.  I had a lot of trouble creating this algorithm program and took on a lot of help in the process.  I was not familiar with the Fibonacci sequence in the first place so having to learn that as much as I could into creating a calculation to interpret that sequence was a real challenge to me and the peers helping.

                                       The artifact that I chose to use for this section covering Databases would be my Bata shoes shop for men and women.  This was created a few years ago and sort of follows the pattern of our modern online retail store.  Basically it is a database coving current, future and popular she trends for consumer purchase.  Covering databases in this section I figured this would be a perfect choice to add within the ePortfolio.  Each tab within this program takes you to another PHP tab to showcase the sections of the database you are wanted to see.  This artifact is awaiting improvements and would have further work to be more precise but for an initial artifact I personally believe this hits the nail on the head. 
   The enhancements needed for this artifact were much needed changes within the script to properly have a functioning site without error(see attached).  These changes make for a better user experience leaving it with a proper running code leaving no faulty errors for the user.  I learned that slight changes within a script can make a rather big issue if not done properly. Several times of trial and error were needed in some of these changes due to the fact that nothing seemed to work right in the end. The major challenge to come up were the changes in general.  The script ran without error before but when reworking for this class I not only had one error but twelve major errors were present.  This left me with a sense of doubt and got me behind in our submission process.  I had to embrace the line by line skills to reproduce a functioning site and database to properly run.  These are well addressed issues and changes and will make a great addition to the final.
